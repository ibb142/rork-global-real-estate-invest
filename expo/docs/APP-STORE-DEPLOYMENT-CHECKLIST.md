## INTEGRATION CODE ALREADY WRITTEN (No developer work needed)

| # | Integration | Backend File | Status |
|---|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Stripe payments (cards, Apple/Google Pay, webhooks) | `backend/trpc/routes/payments.ts` | Done |
| 2 | Plaid bank linking (ACH, link tokens, verification) | `backend/trpc/routes/payments.ts` | Done |
| 3 | KYC engine (Onfido + Jumio with auto-fallback) | `backend/lib/kyc-engine.ts` | Done |
| 4 | JWT auth + 2FA/TOTP + token refresh | `backend/lib/jwt.ts`, `backend/lib/totp.ts` | Done |
| 5 | Email (SendGrid + Mailgun with fallback) | `backend/lib/email.ts` | Done |
| 6 | SMS + WhatsApp (Twilio) | `backend/lib/sms.ts` | Done |
| 7 | Push notifications (Expo Push API) | `backend/trpc/routes/notifications.ts` | Done |

All code gracefully falls back to mock/console mode when API keys are not configured.
Once environment variables are set, code auto-connects to real services.
