# package.json (e.g. when a new dep like `unpdf` is added). `--frozen-lockfile`
# would then abort the build (the exact cause of prod being stuck on an old
# commit). Resolve fresh from package.json instead so new deps always install.

# before any owner-gated request could run. Node 22 (LTS) provides WebSocket natively.

# Chromium + deps power the IVX Browser Automation QA service. The install is
# intentionally non-fatal: if the Alpine package names/versions don't align with
# the current node:22-alpine base image, the container still builds successfully
# and the QA service degrades gracefully to status-only until the browser is
# available. The QA engine points to the system Chromium path and uses
# --no-sandbox / --disable-setuid-sandbox (required for the non-root Render runtime).
# NOTE: package names vary across Alpine versions (font-noto-emoji vs noto-fonts-emoji,
# ttf-freefont vs font-freefont). Try the known set, then a smaller fallback set.

# A hard `COPY --from=server-deps /usr/local/bin/bun ...` is FATAL if the source
# path differs between bun image versions, which froze production on the last-good
# image (the landing-SEO auto-deployer never ran). The autonomous lifecycle's
# step 6 already degrades gracefully to the in-process tsx import-smoke check when
# bun is absent (ivx-runtime-resolver), so the Node-only runner is fully
# self-sufficient and the build can never fail on bun setup.
