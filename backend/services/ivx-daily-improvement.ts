/**
 * IVX Daily Self-Improvement — the single entry point for "Improve IVX today".
 *
 * Turns the owner's daily-improvement command into a durable, crash-safe task that
 * runs the full autonomous engineering loop ONCE:
 *
 *   find one real safe issue → patch → run tests → commit → deploy → verify → prove
 *
 * It deliberately constrains the work to the NON-DESTRUCTIVE / safe-auto-approval
 * categories (UI, copy, tests, logging, error messages, layout/scroll) so the loop
 * can execute end-to-end without an owner prompt. Anything destructive (delete data,
 * production schema, secrets, billing, security, external access) is still gated by
 * the orchestrator's `classifyOwnerExecutionCommand` approval guard.
 *
 * Progress is fully visible in the Live Developer Monitor because the work runs as a
 * standard orchestrator task (`/api/ivx/tasks/:id/blocks` + `/events`).
 *
 * Runtime-light: this module only synthesizes the command + delegates to the
 * orchestrator, so it stays unit-testable without the AI gateway / network / git.
