/**
 * IVX Owner AI Developer Mode — turn the chat into a real executor.
 *
 * Why this exists: the owner explicitly rejected the BLOCKED-only behavior when
 * they ask for development/deploy/audit work. The chat must still refuse to
 * fabricate proof, but it can now trigger a real senior-developer job through
 * the owner-gated worker and stream the proof back into the conversation.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - No fake proof. The chat only reports what the worker returns.
 *   - If the worker returns BLOCKED (missing credentials / owner not signed in),
 *     the chat explains the exact blocker and the required action.
 *   - If the worker succeeds, the chat returns the strict evidence block
 *     (TASK UNDERSTOOD / FILES CHANGED / COMMANDS RUN / STATUS / PROOF).
