/**
 * IVX Capital Deployment Platform — Outreach message drafter (deterministic).
 *
 * BLOCK 23. IVX drafts outreach messages automatically (subject + body) from the
 * owner-supplied recipient + deal context. PURE + deterministic — no AI, no
 * network, no I/O — so it is fully unit-testable and produces consistent drafts.
 *
 * HARD HONESTY RULE: the drafter only uses values the OWNER supplied (recipient
 * name, company, related deal, a context note). It NEVER invents recipient
 * contact details, fake testimonials, or guaranteed-return claims. Unknown
 * fields are simply omitted from the draft (no placeholders like "[NAME]").
 *
 * Drafts are proposals only. They are NOT sent — every draft must be approved by
 * the owner (see ivx-outreach-store) before it can move to a sent state.
