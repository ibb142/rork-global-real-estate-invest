/**
 * REGRESSION — "IVX Owner AI must EXECUTE, never return developer narrative."
 *
 * Reproduces the exact owner-reported failure: asking IVX Owner AI to start
 * building returned a planner/chat narrative ("Architecture Proposal /
 * Execution Plan / Initial Actions / Next Steps Required / Once approved /
 * I will proceed") instead of real senior-developer execution.
 *
 * This test exercises the SAME two production units the live IVX Owner AI chat
 * path uses (`backend/api/ivx-owner-ai.ts` imports both):
 *   1. `buildIVXOwnerAIPlannerDecision` — the router that decides the route.
 *   2. `enforceDeveloperExecutionAnswer` — the output guard applied on the
 *      self_developer route before the answer reaches the owner.
 *
 * Passing here proves the exact failing prompt routes to the senior-developer
 * execution runtime, and that a narrative answer carrying any of the reported
 * phrases is BLOCKED before delivery.
