/**
 * IVX Senior Developer Narrative Gate.
 *
 * The IVX Owner AI chat (and the `/public/chat` fallback it uses) is a text
 * model. When the owner asks about patches, development, fixes, QA, deployment,
 * code, files changed, or "Senior Developer" work, the model has been observed
 * inventing fake patch summaries — e.g. "Workspace Inspection Results",
 * "Recent Patches", "Files Changed: src/investorDiscovery.js, src/dealManager.js",
 * "Deploy Authorization Needed", "If you need further details". None of that is
 * real Senior Developer proof: the chat model cannot read the repo, run tests,
 * commit, or deploy. Those are produced ONLY by the real Senior Developer proof
 * system (Admin → IVX Developer Workspace → Patches → Run Senior Developer),
 * which runs from the signed-in owner app session.
 *
 * This gate enforces the owner's required behavior:
 *  - When a prompt is about Senior Developer / patch / QA / deploy / code work,
 *    OR the model answer contains any fabricated developer-narrative marker, the
 *    answer is replaced.
 *  - If real Senior Developer proof is attached, the answer is the strict proof
 *    block (OWNER_AUTH_ACCEPTED / FILES_CHANGED / ... / FINAL_STATUS).
 *  - Otherwise the answer is the strict BLOCKED block (BLOCKED / REASON /
 *    EXACT_ACTION_REQUIRED).
 *
 * Pure + deterministic (no I/O, network, or AI) so it is fully unit-testable.
