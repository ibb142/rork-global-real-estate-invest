/**
 * IVX Capital Deployment Platform — Deal Pipeline seeder from REAL jv_deals.
 *
 * BLOCK 67 (Phase 2). The genuinely-missing bridge: the Deal Tracking and
 * Capital Pipeline modules were built (BLOCK 22 / 26) but starved of data, while
 * the authoritative `jv_deals` table already holds REAL, owner-published projects
 * (Casa Rosario, PEREZ RESIDENCE, ONE STOP CONSTRUCTORS INC — verified live in
 * BLOCK 3/17/18). This seeder turns those real projects into Deal Tracking +
 * Capital Pipeline entries so "current JV opportunities / active acquisitions"
 * appear in the pipeline from real data.
 *
 * HARD HONESTY RULE (platform-wide, enforced here):
 *   - NOTHING is fabricated. Every seeded record originates from a real published
 *     `jv_deals` row and is attributed `source: 'verified_deal'` with
 *     `sourceDetail: 'jv_deals:<id>'`.
 *   - IDEMPOTENT: a deal already present (matched by case-insensitive name) is
 *     SKIPPED, never duplicated — so the seeder is safe to re-run.
 *   - Unknown economics stay null (capital target only set when the real project
 *     carries a parseable price). Never guessed.
 *
 * Deterministic core (`selectProjectsToSeed`, `projectToDealInput`,
 * `projectToPipelineInput`) is pure + unit-testable; the orchestrator does the
 * real I/O against the authoritative reader + the two durable stores.
