/**
 * IVX Business Context Engine
 *
 * BLOCK 2 — every Owner / public chat conversation must load IVX business
 * context automatically, so questions like "What is Casa Rosario?" are answered
 * from real business data without the caller having to trigger a manual lookup.
 *
 * It assembles five context buckets into a single model-readable block:
 *   1. Projects        — published rows from the authoritative `jv_deals` source.
 *   2. Deal data       — per-deal economics (price / ROI / timeline / min ownership).
 *   3. Company context — who IVX is and what the platform does.
 *   4. Landing context — the public site the projects are rendered on.
 *   5. Owner context   — the owner identity the assistant reports to.
 *
 * The projects/deal buckets are LIVE (read-only over Supabase REST). The
 * company / landing / owner buckets are static config + env. The block is built
 * defensively so a failed project read never blocks the conversation — it just
 * states the honest reason instead of fabricating data.
