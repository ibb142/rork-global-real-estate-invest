/**
 * IVX IA Developer Proof endpoint.
 *
 * Created by IVX IA as one real, end-to-end developer task:
 *   file created -> committed to GitHub -> deployed to Render -> verified live.
 *
 * The route returns the live deployed commit (RENDER_GIT_COMMIT) so that an
 * external caller can confirm GitHub HEAD == Render deployed SHA == endpoint
 * commit, proving a single real task flowed through the full executor chain.
